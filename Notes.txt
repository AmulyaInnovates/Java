Programming Methodologies :-

    Procedure Oriented Programming (POP)
    Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
    Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

⭐🌟⭐-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_OOP's concept-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_⭐🌟⭐

OOP's concept is used in very larg and complex programs.

OOP's concept is based on 4 Principles :-
    
    🥇Encapsulation
        -The main goal of Encapsulation is to restrict dirct access to some of an object's information compononents direclt and to make a controlled way to access/to interact with them.
        -Eg:Banking System
    🥈Abstraction

    🥉Inheritence
        -The main goal Inhritence is to allow a Child class to reuse some of the data, behaviors or properties from a Parent class.
        -Eg: Hierarchy: Vehicles -> Cars , Trains, Planes.
        -Types of Inheritence :- 
                1 Single Inheritence 
                    -1 Parent class and 1 Child Class
                    -Eg: Lion -> Cubs
                2 Multi Level Inheritence
                    -When a Parent class makes 1 Child class and then that Child class becomes the Parent class for another child class.
                    -Eg: Grandfather -> Father -> Son
                3 Hierarchial Inheritence
                    -When a Parent class makes many Child classes.
                    -Eg: Vehicles -> Water-Based vehicles, 2-Wheelers, 4-Wheelers, 6-Wheelers
                4 Hybrid Inheritence
                    -Combination of 2 or more types of Inheritence.
                    -Eg: Animals -> (Mammals -> Cats ->Panthors, Tigers, Lions) & (Egg Layers -> Birds -> Penguins, Parrots, Pigeons)
        
        🔥-_-_-_CODE EXAMPLE_-_-_-_🔥
        class PARENT{
            String 1;
            String 2;
            String 3;
            String 4;
            String 5;

            void Info(){
                System.out.println("This is how to use Inheritence.")
            }
        }

        class CHILD extends PARENT{
            void Data(1,2,3,4,5){
                1= this.1;
                2= this.2;
                3= this.3;
                4= this.4;
                5= this.5;
            }
        }
        class MAIN{
            public static void main(String[] args){
            CHILD s= new CHILD();
            s.Data(My, Name, Is , Amulya , Gupta);
            }
        }
        👨‍💻-_-_-_CODE SUMMARY_-_-_-_👨‍💻

        Parents class has the intial data and methods , it can contain alot of things, but in this case it has been only used for intializing the characters.
        Child class used the keyword, "extends" to inherit all the data and methods from the parent class and combine with code of itself.
        Keyword, "this" is used to access the data given by the user or any data which is enterred in that class.
        In the main class, we hav created an Object which is an instance of the Child class, when we use any of the methods/functions of the Child class, it will perform the action, based on data given in Parenthesis -> (My, Name, Is , Amulya , Gupta)

    
    4️⃣Polymorphism
        -   The main goal of Polymorphism is to let the same action behave differently based on the object that is performing the action.
        -Eg:Imagine you tell different animals to "speak."
                A dog will "bark."
                A cat will "meow."
                A cow will "moo."
    
Constructor is a spcial type of method of a class, it's name is sam as the Class name. A Constructor does not have a return type.

Static keyword allows a variable or an object to be accessed in all the Instances in a class.

🔥A static variable is also known as a "GLOBAL VARIABLE".

Method Overloading :- When there are many method with the same name but different parameters OR different data types, this is called Method Overloading.
    - Eg: 
        void Codingal();
        void Codingal(int A);
        void Codingal(String A);
        float Codingal(String B);

Method Overriding :- When Child class and Parent class has the method named same, we use the keyword "@Override" to override the method in the Parent class.
    - Eg:
